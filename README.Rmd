# Get Canadian Google Mobility Reports Data

Pet project to understand more of SQLite, R Shiny, and data visualization on `r sessioninfo::os_name()`. Contains R code to download and process [Google Mobility data](https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/) for only [Canadian regions](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/new-immigrants/prepare-life-canada/provinces-territories.html). The scripts are to simplify the download, clean, and process steps.

1. Download .zip and only extract Canadian regions .csv files
2. Process raw .csv into national, provincial/territorial, and municipal levels
3. Store into local SQLite database
4. Read tables from SQLite and feed into downstream workflows
